    <h2 style="font-size:150%;">Bio</h2>
    <p>Vulfpeck is an American funk group founded in 2011. The band has released four EPs, four albums, and a silent album on Spotify titled Sleepify â€“ royalties from which funded Vulfpeck's admission-free tour in 2014. The band's most recent album, Hill Climber, was released in December 2018. <br>
            
        <br /> The band members attended University of Michigan's music school. They first came together as a rhythm section for a performance at the Duderstadt Center, a university facility that houses an arts library and other resources. After reading an interview with German producer Reinhold Mack, band founder Jack Stratton conceived of Vulfpeck as an imagined German version of the U.S. session musicians of the 1960s such as Funk Brothers, Wrecking Crew, and Muscle Shoals. The idea was to channel that era of the live rhythm section.
