    <h2 style="font-size:150%;">Bio</h2>
    <p>Vulfpeck is an American funk group founded in 2011. The band has released four EPs, with their most recent album, Hill Climber, being released in December 2018. <br>
            
        <br /> The band members attended the University of Michigan's School of Music. The group first began as a rhythm section for a performance at one of their university's arts facilities, the Duderstadt Center. After reading an interview with German producer Reinhold Mack, the band founder Jack Stratton created Vulfpeck as a German-influenced version of the U.S. session musicians of the 1960s such as Funk Brothers, Wrecking Crew, and Muscle Shoals. Jack sought to channel that era of music into the live rhythm section of their group.
